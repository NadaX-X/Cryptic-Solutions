## Encryption-Decryption-System

The application is designed to encrypt and decrypt messages provided by the user, along with the necessary key, in order to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

The program was developed using the C# programming language.

## Features
Allows users to encrypt and decrypt text data.

## Encryption Block Diagram
1. The plaintext is split into two equal halves. 
2. Then each half will be shifted left by two.
3. Then the two parts are combined.
4. Then they are XORed with the encryption key provided by the user to obtain the ciphertext.

## Decryption Block Diagram
1. The ciphertext is XORed with the encryption key.
2. Then the decrypted plaintext is split into two equal halves.
3. Each half of the decrypted plaintext is shifted right by two.
4. Then the shifted halves are combined to obtain the original plaintext.

## Key Block Diagram
1. The key will be shifted left by two.
2. Then it passes through a P-Box transformation to generate the new key.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Run the Program.cs file to start the application.
4. When prompted, enter your name (or type 'stop' to exit the program).
5. Enter the desired key.
6. The application will display the encrypted ciphertext and the decrypted plaintext.
