# Cryptic Solutions

The Cryptic Solutions project focuses on implementing a secure encryption and decryption algorithm using 
XOR operations, shifting, and key manipulation to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. 
The project is implemented in C# and uses Visual Studio as the development environment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Run the Program.cs file to start the application.
4. When prompted, enter your name (or type 'stop' to exit the program).
5. Enter your desired key.
6. The application will display the encrypted ciphertext and the decrypted plaintext.
